    <div class="divType1">
      <p id="apara1">I love people and I love making them feel great about their appearance.  I have a combined 20 years in the hair and fashion business and it is still thrilling and fulfilling to me.  I have a diploma in Fashion Design and worked in retail buying for a few years before realizing that people were my business.  I took the leap into hairdressing 16 years ago and never looked back.  After an apprenticeship at Civello I studied advanced cutting at the Aveda academy in Toronto and then spent 9 years at Civello here in Oakville.  Once I had children I wanted the freedom to set my own schedule so I have worked from home for 7 years.</p>

      <p id="apara2">During that time I decided to combine my love of fashion with my hairstyling business. By helping women to streamline their wardrobes, work with their shapes and make the most of what they already own, as well as shop or advise on new purchases, my clients are able to go out there and do what they do, knowing they look their best in a wardrobe that brings them joy, or at least eliminates the stress of getting dressed every day!  I have a good eye, a wealth of knowledge and a strong belief that every woman is beautiful.  I moved to my private studio in the spring of 2016 and am excited to welcome old and new clients. </p>

        <p id="review">Chris has been my stylist for over 10 years, originally at a high end Oakville salon, and for the last few years at her home salon. There are many reasons I've stayed with her: I can always count on a great cut and colour, and she listens to what I want while at the same time introducing me to ideas I might not have considered. She is very up to date with current trends, and can just as easily recommend styles for me as for my twenty-something daughters who also trust Chris for both regular cuts and special event styles. Behind the chair she is both a good listener and a well-dressed representation of the fashion styles she can also expertly assist with!</p>
